A project that I hope will let me get closer to bare-metal engine work.

## Roadmap
There's no real roadmap.  There's no real "end project".  This is merely a sandbox for me to dump work into and come back to later if I like something.  Maybe I'll make a game out of this, maybe I won't.

That being said, there are a few things I want to achieve (which pretty much all involve 3D):

- Support for a post-processing pipeline
- 3D audio with music support
- Low-latency inputs
- Extendability
- Code as clean and simple as possible
- A full programming language and VM written to avoid continuous compilation of the engine where there are small changes

## Features
Wow! Even the features have new features!

- It renders nice cubes
- It renders nice sprites
- It renders models
- It's actually pretty neat and has custom materials, shader support, etc.
